# Jema Cinema

A web app for watching movies and TV series online for free, the idea 
is the same as netflix with similar layout look and feel. This project
is only for educational purpose and have no intension for raising 
revenue.

The web content is scrapped from a website vidcloud9.com and served as 
a REST API. The web scrapping is done using python and the API is made
using Flask. The client side fetchs this api and display it for the user.
The backend side which handles users signup, logging in and other features 
is completely isolated from the API and build using spring boot.
